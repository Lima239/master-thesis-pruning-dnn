Master thesis: Improving structured pruning of deep neural networks. Includes code implementation and experiments.

In clustering_algorithms/run.sh you can find an example of running one of the algorithms. 

For testing a clustered matrix with Monarch decomposition use monarch_decomposition/testMonarchDecomposition.py.
